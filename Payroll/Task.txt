Write a Payroll class that uses the following arrays as fields:

- employeeId. An array of seven integers to hold employee identification numbers. The array should be initialized with the following numbers: 5658845, 4520125, 7895122, 8777541, 8451277, 1302850, 7580489.- hours.
An array of seven integers to hold the number of hours worked by each employee.
- payRate. An array of seven doubles to hold each employee's hourly pay rate.
- wages. An array of seven doubles to hold each employee's gross wages.

The class should relate the data in each array through the subscripts. For example, the number in element 0 of the hours array should be the number of hours worked by the employee whose identification number is stored in element 0 of the employeeId array. That same employee's pay rate should be stored in element 0 of the payRate array.

Write the constructor and the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for the class. The class should also have a method that accepts an employee's identification number as an argument and returns the gross pay for that employee.

Demonstrate the class in a complete program that displays each employee number and asks the user to enter that employee's hours and pay rate. It should then display each employee's identification number and gross wages.

Input validation: Do not accept negative values for hours or numbers less than 6.00 for pay rate.

Please implement the above specification using the Java programming language. The deadline is Jan. 20, 8:00 a.m.NB: Collaborative work is strictly prohibited.

No credit will be awarded for pretty much the same solutions. Submitting verbatim or modified versions of the program found over the Internet will result in failing marks.
